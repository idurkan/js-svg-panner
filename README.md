js-svg-pannner is a Javascript module that easily enables panning and zooming of SVG content.

To use it, include svg-panner.js in your HTML, then specify the path to the SVG <g> element whose contents you want to pan by calling svgPanner.setTargetGroup with an appropriate JQuery path string.

See tester.html in the repository root directory for an example.

js-svg-pannner currently depends on JQuery.  I've only tested it against jquery-1.10.2.

At present, I have only tested js-svg-panner against recent versions of Chrome.
